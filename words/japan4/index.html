      </header>

      <div class= "content">
        <p>It is currently Saturday, 8:30PM in Kyoto. Let&rsquo;s pretend I wrote this last night instead of falling asleep before I could even open my laptop.</p>

<p><img src="img/Japan/Day 3/Japan-1.jpg" alt="drawing" class = "photoessay" width = "10" height = "10" data-action="zoom"/>

<p>The day started with some &ldquo;light&rdquo; exercise at the instafamous fushimi inari shrine. Although I have seen the red gates as many times as I have friends who&rsquo;ve been to Japan this summer (which is more than I&rsquo;d like to admit), they are still a wonder to behold in person :) As we started later in the morning, the crowds were what you&rsquo;d imagine - crowded.</p>

<p>Consequently, the torii gates weren&rsquo;t as majestic as I had hoped and the barren daylight didn&rsquo;t help. Hiking to the summit of the mountain lessened tourist density, but I may have been too exhausted to truly appreciate and capture the serenity ahahaha.</p>

<p><img src="img/Japan/Day 3/Japan-4.jpg" alt="drawing" class = "photoessay" width = "10" height = "10" data-action="zoom"/>
<img src="img/Japan/Day 3/Japan-5.jpg" alt="drawing" class = "photoessay" width = "10" height = "10" data-action="zoom"/></p>

<p><img src="img/Japan/Day 3/Japan-7.jpg" alt="drawing" class = "photoessay" width = "10" height = "10" data-action="zoom"/></p>

<p>Finally making it down to the mountain with some overpriced vending machine coffee, we ventured to AEON mall for lunch and much needed rest. After cheating on the fourty degree weather with mall air conditioning, we made our way to the Gion district, venturing the slopes of Sannen-zaka and Ninen-zaka. Loved loved loved loved the traditional buildings and architecture. I don&rsquo;t like to admit that I was a Little jealous of all the kimonos and portrait photographers that flooded the streets (think there were engagement photos going on!). Still curious of what shots were being made, but also a little happy with my own :)</p>

<img src="img/Japan/Day 3/Japan-8.jpg" alt="drawing" class = "photoessay" width = "10" height = "10" data-action="zoom"/>
<img src="img/Japan/Day 3/Japan-11.jpg" alt="drawing" class = "photoessay" width = "10" height = "10" data-action="zoom"/></p>

<p><img src="img/Japan/Day 3/Japan-9.jpg" alt="drawing" class = "photoessay" width = "10" height = "10" data-action="zoom"/>
<img src="img/Japan/Day 3/Japan-10.jpg" alt="drawing" class = "photoessay" width = "10" height = "10" data-action="zoom"/>
<img src="img/Japan/Day 3/Japan-12.jpg" alt="drawing" class = "photoessay" width = "10" height = "10" data-action="zoom"/></p>

<p>Accidentally wound up at the Kiyomizu dera temple to end off the day.</p>

<p>Think that&rsquo;s all but tired writers are unreliable narrators. Zzz.</p>
