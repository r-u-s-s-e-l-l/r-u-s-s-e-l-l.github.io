      <description>Hi so it&amp;rsquo;s been a hot minute since I&amp;rsquo;ve updated anything on this site, but it&amp;rsquo;s 6:45PM on a Monday and I&amp;rsquo;m realizing how crazy it is to be alive right now. Right at this instance of time, alongside hundreds of other human beings. This high will disappear, but putting it out there: it&amp;rsquo;s crazy.
How I feel right now:</description>

      <description>In honour of the approaching typhoon today, here&amp;rsquo;s a typhoon of fast facts because I&amp;rsquo;ve been too tired to keep up with writing the past couple days (aha an excuse for procrastination):
 our last day in Kyoto was more or less uneventful (especially because I was very, very tired. ) We did some more sightseeing and revisited the Gion district. 
 the next day was spent traveling to Hiroshima.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;sitting is for the weak&amp;hellip; but I&amp;rsquo;m weak&amp;rdquo; - Rain
that quote from my younger brother encapsulates the day as we took a bus home, it works better than any description i can write.  RECAP 
We started at the Arashiyama bamboo forest. We were out early to catch a less crowded bamboo forest, but it was still difficult to take pictures without tourists in the background. If I were to ever revisit these famous Japanese destinations, I would definitely catch them at the break of dawn, as crowds of tourists like ourselves don&#39;t do them justice.</description>

      <description>It is currently Saturday, 8:30PM in Kyoto. Let&amp;rsquo;s pretend I wrote this last night instead of falling asleep before I could even open my laptop.
The day started with some &amp;ldquo;light&amp;rdquo; exercise at the instafamous fushimi inari shrine. Although I have seen the red gates as many times as I have friends who&amp;rsquo;ve been to Japan this summer (which is more than I&amp;rsquo;d like to admit), they are still a wonder to behold in person :) As we started later in the morning, the crowds were what you&amp;rsquo;d imagine - crowded.</description>

      <description>Writing this right before we start our third full day, so here&amp;rsquo;s a quick recap of yesterday:
 said a temporary farewell to Tokyo with overpriced conveyor belt sushi that didn&amp;rsquo;t live up to the preceding search. 
 departed from Tokyo station via the bullet train. (almost missed it - we&amp;rsquo;re not going to talk about it) 
 arrived in Kyoto and took a train to Emmachi station, near to our airbnb.</description>

      <description>Our first full day in Japan started off my heading back to Shinjuku station so we could take a train to the Harajuku neighbourhood. We got lost right from the get-go as we couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the office to exchange our JR Pass vouchers ahaha :(
After exploring (aka walking in an unnecessary circle), we found ourselves at the popular Meiji Shrine. While the heat was, well, heat, the walk was still very serene thanks to the shade and the forestry.</description>

      <description>hello hello! This is the start of a small attempt at an equally small travel blog for my trip to Japan :)
Since I&amp;rsquo;m traveling with family, my dad did most of the planning haha but at least that means I can focus more on writing, photography and vlogs hehe.
Day 0
We spent the majority of today flying and busing, but here&#39;s some first impressions of the few hours we got to look around the Shinjuku area: There are lots of people.</description>

      <description>it&amp;rsquo;s been a while since I&amp;rsquo;ve written anything.
 Can actions be justified by intent, or are the sins we commit simply based on the crime? 
 How do I know if I&amp;rsquo;m morally unreliable? 
 What does it mean to be a terrible person? Is it a measure of nonkindness or a state of being or &amp;hellip; ?</description>

      <description>When I first thought of starting up my own blog, there was an extensive list of words I wanted to write on.  But as I finally start to work on an idea thatâ€™s been rotting away in the room at the back of my head, I find it to be void. It&#39;s contents escaped from a cage of suffocating pretentious.  that might not be such a bad thing.</description>

      <description> Religion is like your camera.  If you spend your entire life just breaking apart the minute details youâ€™ll never create anything.  On the other hand, if you only blindly snap away, your pictures wonâ€™t ever improve. </description>
