            <p>Dusting off my camera has been a peculiar experience. Part of it is has been like riding a bike - all the dials and clicks still feel about right. A little awkward, but right. Part of it feels completely different, as if I am engaging in a different craft than that of a past life, one where I  would greedily capture moments without a second care. Learning to film my current realities has made me painfully cognizant of the cycle my life (and perhaps most of the world) has drifted into. A monotonous interchanging between moments of work and wandering, those of painful stillness and ignorant action.</p>
<p>There is no sole perpetrator that has sent me adrift. Sure, a global pandemic, heartbreak and dashes of existential dread could be blamed, but they all ultimately fall under the umbrella that is living this very reality.</p>
<p><img src="/img/1/DSC09357.jpg" alt="picture of a lone bench"></p>
<p>And so, I mourn the many causes of this frighteningly normal, reactionary pattern of living. I mourn the past selves that I can no longer bring out at will, the realities I once knew that now feel as fleeting as dreams. Perhaps I even mourn for my present reality, for it too will not last forever.</p>
<p><img src="/img/1/DSC09369.jpg" alt="picture of a sticker with fucked up writen on it"></p>
<p>Melancholic as this all sounds, this blunt introspection also yields fascination. There is nothing special about all these rambly thoughts, people change all the time, everywhere. It is quite simple - unremarkable, if you will. But that very fundamental phenomena is a small part of the grand scheme of things. And the minute intricacies of the latter is what keeps this life interesting, does it not?</p>

<p>Perhaps I have learned that change is normal. That change, as intrusive of a force it is on our present selves, is also gently knit into the fabric of living. Perhaps I will change to one day be able to embrace change without mourning the past, without anxiously peaking at the future. Or perhaps I have learned nothing at all, and this is all just nonsense embeded in the chaos that is this brain of mine.</p>
<p>(un)Remarkable.</p>
